This middleware is designed to take a requirejs-enabled project and
dynamically alter the static page output to expand requirejs dependencies into
their script components before the loader executes in the browser. By doing
this, the aim is to make debugging these scripts easier in the browser.

CAUTION: This library was built to scratch a particular itch, and therefore
does not cater to any use-cases beyond that. The extensive use of regexes
should be replaced with script evaluation, and some kind of caching mechanism
should be added to prevent unnecessary processing.
